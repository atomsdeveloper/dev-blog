// Write below about routes in Next.js
// In Next.js, routes are defined by the file structure in the `pages` directory.
// Each file corresponds to a route, and the file name determines the URL path.
// For example, a file named `about.js` in the `pages` directory will be accessible at `/about`.
// Dynamic routes can be created using square brackets, like `[slug].js`, which allows for variable paths.
// Additionally, Next.js supports nested routes by creating subdirectories within the `pages` directory.
// For example, a file at `pages/blog/[slug].js` would be accessible at `/blog/[slug]`.
// This structure allows for a clear and organized way to manage routes in a Next.js application.
// Note: The above code is a simple example of a PostPage component in Next.js.
// It does not include any dynamic routing or server-side logic, which would typically be handled in a file like `src/app/post/[slug]/page.tsx`.
// The PostPage component is a static page that displays a title and a paragraph of text.
// In a real application, you would likely fetch data from an API or a database to display dynamic content based on the post's slug or other parameters.
// The `PostPage` component can be used as a placeholder or a starting point for building a more complex post page in a Next.js application.
// For dynamic routing, you would typically use a file structure like `src/app/post/[slug]/page.tsx` where `[slug]` is a dynamic segment that can be replaced with actual post slugs.
// This allows Next.js to handle requests for different posts based on their unique slugs
// and render the appropriate content for each post dynamically.
